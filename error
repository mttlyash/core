there is a major error while downloading dependencies in this app. 
I just click to download dependency the page goes on infinite loop and never stop and I thought that i have to wait for some time but it is same after reloading the whole page the written code was erased.
I am uploading a screen shot of the page to show the error kindly check and update your issues.
Just check the screen shot that it was told me to install the core.js package which is already installed and also check the fork loop also.
I think i just wait more than 3 hours thinking it should be same but it was not.
